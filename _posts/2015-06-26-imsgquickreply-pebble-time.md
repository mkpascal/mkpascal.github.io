First, please understand that this is **highly** experimental. The app is not even in the Pebble App Store.

iMsgQuickReply is a Pebble app that will allow you to send quick replies to your iMessage contacts.
It needs an iMessage bridge. So, you will need an OS X computer, preferably running as a server.

As you know, iOS APIs doesn't allow you to send specific actions to a notification you just received.
It is a known limitation of ACNS. Using this hack, you will be able to reproduce a quick reply behavior with your Pebble.

You won't be able to send a quick reply to a notification you just received.
This app will just allow you to send quick replies to a list of contacts you previously specified.

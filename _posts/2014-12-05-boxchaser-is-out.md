I&#8217;m happy to announce that BoxChaser 1.0.0 is finally out on the iOS App Store.

<img src="http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple1/v4/3e/c1/cd/3ec1cdb1-9ef7-82b3-778e-2ffdbe14c114/screen1136x1136.jpeg" style="width:20%;float:left;" />

BoxChaser is a simple game with two game modes, relax and revenge!

Just move your phone and chase boxes or the boxes will chase you.

It is compatible with iOS 7+. This app is optimized for the new iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.

A version 1.1 is already on the way with bug fixes, in-app purchases, and Game Center support.

You can download it using this link : **<http://appsto.re/us/dPey4.i>**.Â You can also look for &#8220;**BoxChaser**&#8221; in the App Store. (Edit: It might be unavailable right now. I'm working on fixing this asap.)

Enjoy! :bowtie:

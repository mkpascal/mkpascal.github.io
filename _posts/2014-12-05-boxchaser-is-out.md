I&#8217;m happy to announce that BoxChaser 1.0.0 is finally out on the iOS App Store.

<img src="https://www.mkpascal.net/images/public/boxchaser.jpeg" style="width:20%;float:left;padding: 0px 20px 10px 0px;" />

BoxChaser is a simple game with two game modes, relax and revenge!

Just move your phone and chase boxes or the boxes will chase you.

It is compatible with iOS 7+. This app is optimized for the new iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.

You can look for &#8220;**BoxChaser**&#8221; in the App Store.

**Update (1/20/2023)**: New release for iOS 11+. Available at https://apps.apple.com/app/boxchaser-2/id1619427697

Enjoy! :bowtie:

I&#8217;m happy to announce that BoxChaser 1.0.0 is finally out on the iOS App Store.

BoxChaser is a simple game with two game modes, relax and revenge!

Just move your phone and chase boxes or the boxes will chase you.

It is compatible with iOS 7+. This app is optimized for the new iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.

A version 1.1 is already on the way with bug fixes, in-app purchases, and Game Center support.

Android users, be patient. An Android version will be released at the end of the month.

You can download it using this link : **<http://appsto.re/us/dPey4.i>**. You can also look for &#8220;**BoxChaser**&#8221; in the App Store.

Enjoy! :bowtie:

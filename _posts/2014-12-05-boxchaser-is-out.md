I&#8217;m happy to announce that BoxChaser 1.0.0 is finally out on the iOS App Store.

<img src="https://www.mkpascal.net/images/public/boxchaser.jpeg" style="width:20%;float:left;padding: 0px 20px 10px 0px;" />

BoxChaser is a simple game with two game modes, relax and revenge!

Just move your phone and chase boxes or the boxes will chase you.

It is compatible with iOS 7+. This app is optimized for the new iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.

<strike>You can download it using this link : **<http://appsto.re/us/dPey4.i>**.Â You can also look for &#8220;**BoxChaser**&#8221; in the App Store.</strike> Edit: It is now discontinued.

Enjoy! :bowtie:

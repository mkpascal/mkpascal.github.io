Hi. My name is Pascal. Iâ€™m 33 and I live in San Francisco. I was born and raised in France.

**I'm currently looking for a job as a Ruby on Rails Software Engineer.**

If you want to know more about my professional work experiences, education, please visit my LinkedIn. You can find some of my code on GitHub as well.

On this website, you will be able to find posts about everything I'm interested about: the tech world, the music world, the broadcast world.

Enjoy.

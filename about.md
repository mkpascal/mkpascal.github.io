Hi. My name is Pascal. Iâ€™m 28 and I live in San Francisco, working as a software engineer. I was born and raised in France.

You'll find on this website my personal/side projects. If you want to know more about my professional work experiences, education, please visit my LinkedIn. You can find some of my code on GitHub as well.

You will also be able to find posts about the tech world, the music world, the broadcast world.

Enjoy.
